# LinkedIn Jobs Web Scraper  

This project showcases a web scraping solution I built to collect job postings directly from LinkedIn. Using **Python** and **Beautiful Soup**, the scraper extracts key information such as job title, company, location, posting date, and a short description.  

The scraped data is stored in clean **CSV files** and refined with **Pandas** for easier analysis and reporting. To make the process fully automated, I integrated the scraper with **n8n**, allowing scheduled runs and hands-free workflows.  

This project highlights my skills in:  
- Web scraping with Python  
- Data cleaning and organization  
- Workflow automation using n8n  
- Preparing structured datasets for real-world use  

The end result is a reliable system that continuously gathers and organizes LinkedIn job data, ready to be used for analytics, dashboards, or recruitment research.
